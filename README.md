# <center> Space REST API </center>
Started as a backend for collecting space images from NASA.
Was converted into a Rest API for a small Todo Kanban Board.

It will in the future hold Celery tasks to connect to different rest end points to keep them going in intervals.

Space Rest API will be transferred to a SpringBoot project
